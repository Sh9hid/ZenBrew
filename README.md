AI for Code Completion

## Features
* üöÄ As good as VSCode Copilot.
* üîê Zenbrew clears session per use.
* üî¨ Works with natural language or any coding one.

Zenbrew provides Code Search (from Github Gist, StackOverflow), and AI Code Generation. With multiple options can be enabled at the same time.

To generate/search code, use `// find {what you need}.`. For example:

```js
// find binary search in JavaScript.

// generate binary search function in Python.
```
# Usage:
- Make sure there is a dot at the end of `{what you need}` search phrase
- You can use either `// find` or `// generate` to trigger Zenbrew code completion. Both are the same.
